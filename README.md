# Wikiframe

Wikiframe is a **modular and fully-featured wiki** powered by Git and [GitHub](https://pages.github.com/) Pages and pull requests.

Wikiframe is a fork of [git-wiki-theme](https://github.com/Drassil/git-wiki-theme) maintained specifically for [Framewiki](https://framewiki.net), the unofficial Framework Wiki. Many features not used by Framewiki have been removed for the sake of maintainability, and others have been rewritten to better suit our needs.


## Features 

* **Easy collaboration** with forks, pull requests and roles
* **Simple customization** with hooks for easily including custom HTML and CSS.
* **Table of contents** generated for each page automatically.
* **Links to non-existent wiki pages are "[red](red.md)"**, and you can click on them to automatically create a new page.
* **History and revision comparison** powered by Git --- everything you need from a wiki platform.
* **Easy automation** using GitHub Actions.
* **No databases!** Only static files that can be downloaded in a few seconds.
* **Blazing fast** and free thanks to GitHub Pages and Jekyll Server Side Generation process.
* **Multiple free search engines!** on a static site.
* **[External links](http://example.com)** get a special icon automatically.

You can use it with the Jekyll ["remote_theme"](https://github.com/benbalter/jekyll-remote-theme) feature or fork/copy the master branch and start your wiki in just 1 minute.
